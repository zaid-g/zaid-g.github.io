I graduated with my Master's in Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington-Seattle advised Prof. Howard Chizeck. My research interests are in the fields of reinforcement learning and robotics.

Master's Research
======
I developed virtual reality teleoperation control methods for a robot arm for dismantling munitions left in waters from past military activities. The implementation was built using ROS, matlab, and simulink, and implements optimized methods for navigation and control within the virtual environment. Here is a video of me showing the navigation and control methods and dismantling a munition (in simulation).

Academics
======
Before joining UW, I completed my undergraduate in Electrical Engineering: Computer Engineering path at Ohio University. I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a 3.86 GPA. I received multiple awards including Tau Beta Pi's Outstanding Student in Computer Engineering Award for both Junior and Senior Years.
